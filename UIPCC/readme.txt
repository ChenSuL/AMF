README file for UIPCC
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Author: Jamie Zhu <jimzhu@GitHub>
Author: Zibin Zheng, CUHK. For the initial Java implementation.
Last updated: 2014/6/26.

This package implements five baseline QoS prediction approaches, including 
UMEAN, IMEAN, UPCC, IPCC, UIPCC(a.k.a. WSRec). 

The implementations are based on a combination of Python (2.7) and C++ 
programming languages, in order to achieve both speed and simplicity. To do 
so, Cython (http://cython.org/) is used. The core algorithms are implemented 
using C++, and we obtain an overall of 10+ times speedup than pure Python 
implementation. 

You can refer to the README.md of WSRec repository for instructions of
installing Cython. But you do not need it if you only want to reproduce the 
experimental results by executing the scripts that I have provided (You may 
even not need any execution because I have also provided most of the results). 
Cython is only needed when you modify the c++ source files and want to 
re-compile them. In addition, it is worth noting that our implementation is 
also based on numpy and scipy packages (http://www.scipy.org/), so you would 
also need to install these packages first.

Using the package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For ease of reproducing and compare with other approaches, we provide the 
detailed experimental results with five metrics (MAE, NMAE, RMSE, MRE, NPRE), 
under the "result/" directory, after running the above five QoS prediction 
approaches on "data/". E.g.,"result/average/avg_rtResult_0.05.txt" records the 
evaluation results under matrix density = 5%. In particular, each experiment 
under each time slice is run for 20 times and the average result (including 
std value) over 20*64 runs is reported. These results can be directly used 
for your research work.

On the other hand, if you want to reproduce our experiments, you can run the 
program with our provided Python scripts "run_rt.py" and "run_tp.py".

>> python run_rt.py
>> python run_tp.py

Make sure the external module "UIPCC.so" exists. If not, you can build it by 
the follow command. Note that the current version only works on Linux.

>> python setup.py build_ext --inplace
